### I am Varsha :smile:

I am currently a staff engineer at Oracle.
I have an avid interest in data science and machine learning. I have also interned at Google Asia Pacific from October 2021 to June 2022 as a Cloud Architect with the Google Cloud team.

I have a vast skillset of data analytics such as Power Bi, and other data viz tools, SQL, Python, and some backend development experience as well.
